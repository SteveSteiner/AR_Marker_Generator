# AR Marker Generator

This is a basic QR Code Generator using the QRCoder package by Raffael Herrmann and WinForms.

The settings for the code generation are specifically optimized for AR use, tested in Android devices and the Microsoft HoloLens.
- Optimized for most lighting conditions (obviously won't work if too dark)
- Low angle dependance
- High distance recognition

Nothing fancy, but easy to use with Vuforia or built-in.
